# Unsuccessful-recall-curiosity-and-personality

Study using an episodic memory paradigm where we also measure curiosity through subsequent information-seeking choices.
Paradigm is based off of Brooks et al., 2021

Notably, substantial individual differences in how people are motivated after unusuccessful recall were present in our prior work. Here, we collected behavioural data from our task and personality questionnaires (Epistemic Curioisty, Perceptual Curiosity, Intolerance of Uncertainity and Big-5) from a large number of participants (sample size calculaiton was 150). 

Within this project are scripts and files associated with the behavioural task, processing and analysis of behavioural data and scoring of questionnaires
